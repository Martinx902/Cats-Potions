  advice: 'Today was a really weird day. I made an interesting potion that I think
    I won''t try no more. It made me feel extremely happy for a couple of hours and
    then depressed for the rest of the day. I tried this new seed who seemed even
    glad that I planted it, the spiky one and the multicolored too, mixed for some
    time, and got that strange yellow potion. If you ever do this. Don''t try it,
    it isn''t worth it.  '
