  sentences:
  - I appreciate you bringing it, but I'm afraid I won't be able to make the cake
    any more.
  - I fell asleep and almost burnt down the kitchen! I guess as you get older you
    fall asleep more easily...
  - I'm sorry you won't be able to taste the cake, but don't worry. I made this with
    the ashes! hehe
