  sentences:
  - Hello again, little cat. I was just about to make a homemade magic mushroom cake.
  - I thought of experimenting with various things and I think magic mushrooms are
    the key.
  - However, they are not well absorbed by the soil, so perhaps a tonic made from
    them would work.
  - I'll give you some if you help me!
