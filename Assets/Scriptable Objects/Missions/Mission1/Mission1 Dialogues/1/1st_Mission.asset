  sentences:
  - What do these old bear eyes see! It's unusual to see new faces in the forest.
  - I assume you are passing through, if not stay as long as you need to...hardly
    anyone visits the place anymore
  - 'Why? Well, you see, some time ago the spring in the forest fell ill and little
    by little it is losing the magical power it once had. '
  - It is sad, only fools like me have decided to stay until the day comes when the
    magic of the glade disappears.
  - "\xA1\xA1\xBF\xBF??!!"
  - What do you mean you're an apprentice magician?!! What are you doing so far away
    from the academy?!!
  - What do you mean, you want to help?
  - 'Well then .... In that case I came up with several ways to heal the forest.
    Let''s start by gathering the ingredients to make a basic magic potion. '
  - 'You''ll need to bring me a couple of items to get started.
